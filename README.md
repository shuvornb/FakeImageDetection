# Deep Fake Detection
The rapid progress in synthetic image generation and manipulation
has now come to a point where it raises significant
concerns on the social implications. This not only leads to a
loss of trust in digital content, but also causes further harm by
spreading false information. We are confronted today with
manipulated visual content in almost any digital medium.
Images and videos particularly of human faces are also victim
of these manipulations. We have seen such manipulations
to alter political leaderâ€™s speech jeopardizing the reputation
of an entire nation. In recent times, such manipulations are
widely used in the porn industry to create revenge porn.
Identity theft and financial fraud are also some of the consequences
of these forgeries. With the development of more
and more advanced manipulation techniques, fake contents
are getting more believable creating a severe threat to human
civilization. So, detection of these forgeries is of paramount
importance.
A lot of researchers have already addressed the problem
from different perspectives. Researchers are coming up with
different models to identify different type of forgeries. In
general, these models perform well on the type of fake they
were trained on but perform miserably bad on the other type
of fakes. Again these models tend to be dependent on high
quality images to predict while in the real world, mostly
these fakes are in low quality. So, we investigate two aspects
of the problem. (a) Performance of fake detection models on
generalizability (b) Performance of fake detection models
on low resolution data. We conduct multiple experiments to
confirm the first observation. For the second one, we provide
a solution that yields a maximum of 35% improvement in the
test accuracy.

# How to download the actual dataset: 
We have provided some sample data in our sample_data folder but to train and test on actual data one can refer to this link:
https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics/tree/master/dataset 


# How to run the experiments:

To extract face frames from a video-
```bash
python3 video_to_face_extractor.py --input_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/sample_video/from --output_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/sample_video/to/ --image_shape=64
```
To shuffle and shift images from one folder to another:
```bash
python3 shuffle_shift_data.py --input_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/sample_shift/from/ --output_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/sample_shift/to/ --shift_amount=3
```
To train a model on data_256:
1) Meso4: 
```bash
python3 driver.py --mode=train --model_name=meso4 --data_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/data_256/df
```
2) Xception:
```bash
python3 driver.py --mode=train --model_name=xception --data_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/data_256/df
```
To test a model on data_256
```bash
python3 driver.py --mode=test --test_model_path=fakeimagedetection/saved_models/meso4_df_tr_ts_Tue_Nov_30_15_51_21_2021/ --data_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/data_256/df
```

To test a model on data_64
```bash
python3 driver.py --mode=test --test_model_path=fakeimagedetection/saved_models/meso4_df_tr_ts_Tue_Nov_30_15_51_21_2021/ --data_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/data_64/df
```
To test a model on data_64 with EDSR Upsampling
```bash
python3 driver.py --mode=test --test_model_path=fakeimagedetection/saved_models/meso4_df_tr_ts_Tue_Nov_30_15_51_21_2021/ --data_path=fakeimagedetection/sample_data/data_64/df --upsample=True
```
